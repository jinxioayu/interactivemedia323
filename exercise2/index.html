	<li>
  <p><strong>Measure the edges of the windows where you want to hang the lights. </strong>The way，<br>you’ll know how many strands of what size you need to fully outline all your windows.<br>Use a measuring tape to get exact measurements, as you don’t want to be a few inches or<br>centimeters short of making your window look perfect.</p>
  <ul>
  	<li>Make sure there’s a power outlet nearby to plug the lights into if you don’t plan on<br>using battery-operated lights.</li>
  </ul>
    </li>

   <li>
  <p><strong>Choose mini-lights or C6 lights to better outline your windows.</strong >There are other<br>types of Christmas light bulbs available to use as well, if you’d prefer to lend your<br>windows a slightly different aesthetic. For example, LEDs have a more bluish tint. There are<br>also wide-angle LEDs, transparent, ceramic, globe, net lights, and RGB LEDs.</p>
  <ul>
  	<li>Not only are mini-lights cheap, but the light they give off is more ethereal and<br>delicate since they’re smaller.</li>
  	<li>C6 lights are the smallest version of the traditional strawberry-shaped Christmas<br>bulb, so they look classic without being overwhelming.</li>
  </ul>
     </li>

   <li>
  <p><strong>Pick battery operated LEDs for a cleaner look.</strong> Sometimes, seeing an extension<br>cord attached to the lights can ruin the look of a wonderful display. Furthermore,<br>because battery-operated lights don’t use electricity, they give off less<br>heat and are less likely to pose a fire hazard.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
  <p><strong>Match your wires to the woodwork of your window.</strong>If you have white woodwork, a<br>string of Christmas lights with green wire will stand out and be less subtle than a<br>string with white wire. Dark woodwork requires darker wire.</p>
  <ul>
  	<li>If the wires match the woodwork, the lights themselves will be more emphasized.</li>
  	<li>The shorter the distance between each lightbulb, the denser the lights will be and<br>the more focus will be taken away from the wires.</li>
  </ul>
     </li>   
<img src="images/aid11340421-v4-728px-Hang-Christmas-Lights-Inside-Windows-Step-5.jpg.webp"/>
  <li>
  <p><strong>Test that your lights and cords are working. </strong>You don’t want to get them all set up,<br>only to plug them in and discover a section of the lights are dark. All you have to do is<br>plug the lights into an outlet and make sure each bulb is glowing.</p>
  <ul>
  	<li>If one of the bulbs is broken or dim, see if you can purchase a replacement bulb<br>rather than an entirely different strand of lights.</li>
  	<li>Frayed or otherwise damaged cords are a safety hazard and should not be used at<br>all.</li>

 <ol>
	<li>
<p><strong>Purchase plastic stick-on clips/hooks for the inside of the window frame. </strong>The<br>clips will be easy to remove at the end of the holiday season and won’t damage your<br>windows or leave behind sticky residue. These can be found at most hardware stores.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Each window usually requires 6-8 clips.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<img src="images/aid11340421-v4-728px-Hang-Christmas-Lights-Inside-Windows-Step-7.jpg.webp"/>
<li>
<p><strong>Place the plastic clips on the inside of the window frame. </strong>To do this, remove the<br>backing from one side of the adhesive strip and press that side firmly on the window<br>frame. Wait 30 seconds, then remove the paper from the second side of the adhesive and<br>press the flat end of the plastic clip against the second side.</p>
<ul>
	<li>You only need to place the clips on the top and sides of the window frame.</li>
	<li>The clips should be about 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) apart and spaced out<br>regularly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<img src="images/aid11340421-v4-728px-Hang-Christmas-Lights-Inside-Windows-Step-8.jpg.webp"/>
<li>
<p><strong>Let the clips set for at least an hour. </strong>If you hang anything on them prior to the time<br>running out, the clips may come down. That might damage not just the window frame<br>from the clips being removed incorrectly, but also the Christmas lights if they are dropped<br>from a substantial height onto a hard surface.</p>
</li>
<img src="images/aid11340421-v4-728px-Hang-Christmas-Lights-Inside-Windows-Step-9.jpg.webp"/>
<li>
<p><strong>Slide the lights into the clips. </strong>Squeeze the wires of the string of Christmas lights<br>into each clip. Then, work your way carefully around the window frame, squeezing<br>more wires into place as you go.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Try to get the light bulbs to all face in the same direction.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Add additional decorations to the window, if you’d like.</strong>For example, you can<br>place some battery operated candles on the windowsill or some festive garlands. If<br>the garlands come with their own lights, make sure you like how they look in conjunction<br>with the ones around the window.</p>

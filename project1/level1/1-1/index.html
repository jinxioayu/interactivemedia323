<h1>——Poem by Elizabeth Frye</h1>
<p>Do not stand at my grave and weep,</p>
<P>I an not there, I do not sleep.</P>
<br>
<p>I am in a thousand winds that blow,</p>
<p>across Northreand's bright and shining snow.</p>
<br>
<P>I am the gentle showers of rain,</P>
<p>on Westfall's fields of golden grain.</p>
<br>
<p>I am in the morning hush, of Stranglethorn' s jungle,</p>
<P>green and lush.</P>
<br>
<p>I am in the drums loud and grand,</p>
<p>the thunderous hooves across Nagrand.</p>
<br>
<p>I am the stars warmly gleaming,</p>
<p>over Darnassus softly dreaming.</p>
<br>
<p>I am in the birds that sing,</p>
<p>I am in each lovely thing.</p>
<br>
<p>Do not stand at my grave and cry,</p>
<p>I am not there. I do not die.</p>

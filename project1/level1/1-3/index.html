<h1>Do not stand at my grave and weep —— Poem by Elizabeth Frye</h1>
<br>
<p><strong>Do not</strong>stand at my grave and weep,                              I an not there, I do not sleep.</p>
<br>
<p>I am <strong>in a thousand winds</strong> that blow,                            across Northreand's bright and shining snow.</p>
<br>
<p>I am <strong>the gentle showers</strong> of rain,                               on Westfall's fields of golden grain.</p>
<br>
<p>I am <strong>in the morning hush, of Stranglethorn' s jungle</strong>,          green and lush.</p>
<br>
<p>I am <strong>in the drums loud and grand</strong>,                              the thunderous hooves across Nagrand.</p>
<br>
<p>I am <strong>the stars warmly gleaming</strong>,                                over Darnassus softly dreaming.</p>
<br>
<p>I am <strong>in the birds that sing</strong>,                                   I am <strong>in each lovely thing</strong>.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Do not</strong> stand at my grave and cry,                              I am not there. I do not die.</p>

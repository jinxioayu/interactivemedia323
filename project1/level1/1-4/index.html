<br>
<p>I am in a thousand winds that blow,across Northreand's bright and shining snow.I am the gentle showers of rain,on Westfall's fields of golden grain.I am in the morning hush, of Stranglethorn' s jungle,green and lush.I am in the drums loud and grand,the thunderous hooves across Nagrand.I am the stars warmly gleaming,over Darnassus softly dreaming.I am in the birds that sing,I am in each lovely thing.Do not stand at my grave and cry,I am not there. I do not die.</p>
